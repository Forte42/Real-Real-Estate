## Description

---

"Real estate is an imperishable asset, ever increasing in value. It is the most solid security that human ingenuity has devised. It is the basis of all security and about the only indestructible security." - Russell Sage

Housing is an investment that has several financial benefits, including:

- Portfolio Diversification
- Increases in Value
- Quality of Life

However, real estate purchases, especially for first time home buyers, can be a highly emotional decision, driven by rationales that are not based on analytics.

The purpose of this project is to build an application that enables home buyers to make more educated decisions on real estate. Features include:

- Display historical housing prices by county - This allows users to see trends, such as which counties are gaining or losing value. The data will be displayed in different views, such as in a datagrid, line plot, barchart or a map.
- MACD Analysis
- Provides predictive analytics for future real estate prices. This allows users to execute simulations, such as the Monte Carlo simulation, to determine which county is a better real estate purchase.

## User Stories

---

Our MVP will be based on the following user stories to start:

As a home buyer, I want to fetch historical housing prices by county in America from 1997-2022

As a home buyer, I want to list which counties gained or loss value in a specifc timeframe

As a home buyer, I want to view a map of which counties gained or loss value in a specific timeframe

As a home buyer, I want to determine which county has the highest probability of gaining or losing in the future

## Technology Stack
